docend

sctrl	AssertSpecial
req	flag	string
opt	flag2	string
opt	flag3	string
docbgn
This controller allows you to assert up to three special flags simultaneously. MUGEN will automatically "deassert" each flag at every game tick, so you must assert a flag for each tick that you want it to be active.

The flag name can be one of the following:

intro
Tells MUGEN that the character is currently performing his intro
pose. Must be asserted on every tick while the intro pose is
being performed.
invisible
Turns the character invisible while asserted. Does not affect
display of afterimages.
roundnotover
Tells MUGEN that the character is currently performing his win
pose. Should be asserted on every tick while the win pose is being
performed.
nobardisplay
Disables display of life, super bars, etc. while asserted.
noBG
Turns off the background. The screen is cleared to black.
noFG
Disables display of layer 1 of the stage (the foreground).
nostandguard
While asserted, disables standing guard for the character.
nocrouchguard
While asserted, disables crouching guard for the character.
noairguard
While asserted, disables air guard for the character.
noautoturn
While asserted, keeps the character from automatically turning
to face the opponent.
nojugglecheck
While asserted, disables juggle checking. P2 can be juggled
regardless of juggle points.
nokosnd
Suppresses playback of sound 11, 0 (the KO sound) for players
who are knocked out. For players whose KO sound echoes, nokosnd
must be asserted for 50 or more ticks after the player is KOed
in order to suppress all echoes.
nokoslow
While asserted, keeps MUGEN from showing the end of the round in
slow motion.
noshadow
While asserted, disables display of this player's shadows.
globalnoshadow
Disables display of all player, helper and explod shadows.
nomusic
While asserted, pauses playback of background music.
nowalk
While asserted, the player cannot enter his walk states, even if
he has control. Use to prevent run states from canceling into
walking.
timerfreeze
While asserted, keeps the round timer from counting down. Useful
to keep the round from timing over in the middle of a splash
screen.
unguardable
While asserted, all the asserting player's HitDefs become
unblockable, i.e., their guardflags are ignored.
docend

sctrl	AttackDist
req	value	0
docbgn
Changes the value of the guard.dist parameter for the player's current HitDef. The guard.dist is the x-distance from P1 in which P2 will go
into a guard state if P2 is holding the direction away from P1.
The effect of guard.dist only takes effect when P1 has movetype = A.

If the player is a helper, binds the player to a specified position relative to its parent. If the player is not a helper, this controller does nothing.
If the player's parent is destroyed (for example, if it is a
helper, and executes DestroySelf), then the effect of
BindToParent is terminated.
docend

sctrl	BindToRoot
opt	time	0
opt	facing	0

The LifeAdd controller is not affected by the player's defense multiplier.
docend

sctrl	DestroySelf
opt	recursive	0
opt	removeexplods	0
docbgn
If called by a helper-type character, DestroySelf causes that character to be removed from the field of play. DestroySelf is not valid for non-helper characters.
Any players or explods bound to the helper will be forcefully unbound when DestroySelf
is executed.
Any unremoved explods belonging to a destroyed helper will become orphaned.
docend

sctrl	DisplayToClipboard
req	text	string
opt	params	exp	exp	exp	exp	exp	exp

docbgn
The Explod controller is a flexible tool for displaying animations such as sparks, dust and other visual effects. Its functionality includes that of GameMakeAnim, which is now deprecated.
The position of an explod that is bound to a player is determined only after
all player updates have completed (compared to helpers, which are created
relative to the player's immediate position when the controller was executed).
This behavior is necessary to make explods bind properly to the player's
screen position.
For example, assume the player has an x velocity of 5 and a position of (160,0).
If an explod is created with an offset of 0,0 relative to p1, then the explod's
actual screen position will be 165,0.

Parameters to the ForceFeedback controller may not be specified using arithmetic expressions. It is an exception in this regard.
docend

sctrl	FallEnvShake
docbgn
Shakes the screen using the fall.envshake parameters set by an attack (see HitDef controller). This controller is effective only if GetHitVar(fall.envshake.time) is not zero, and it sets GetHitVar(fall.envshake.time) to zero after being executed. This controller is used in common1.cns to shake the screen when a player falls, and is not normally useful otherwise.
docend

sctrl	GameMakeAnim

sctrl	HitBy
req	value	string
opt	time	0
docbgn
Temporarily specifies the types of hits that are be allowed hit to the player.
The player has two hit attribute slots, which can be set using the
value or value2 parameters to the HitBy controller. These slots can
also be set by the NotHitBy controller. When a slot is set, it gets
a timer (the effective time) which counts down toward zero. If the
timer has not yet reached zero, the slot is considered to be active.
The player can be hit by a HitDef only if that HitDef's attribute
appears in all currently active slots.
Using the HitBy controller sets the specified slot to contain only
those hit attributes which appear in the HitBy attribute string.

Defines a single hit of the player's attack. If the player's Clsn1 box (red) comes in contact with his opponent's Clsn2 box (blue), and the HitDef was define on or before that particular point in time, then the specified effect will be applied. This is one of the more complex, but most commonly-used controllers.
A single HitDef is valid only for a single hit. To make a move hit several times, you must trigger more than one HitDef during the attack.
The behavior of HitDef is undefined when executed from a
[Statedef -2] block while the player has another player's
state and animation data.

docbgn
Defines a hit override. If the player is hit by an attack of the specified type, he will go to the specified state number instead of his default gethit behavior. Up to 8 hit overrides can be active at one time.
If P1 has one or more active HitOverrides, P1 will not be affected by any
of P2's matching HitDefs that have any of the following characteristics:

p1stateno parameter value is not -1
p2getp1state parameter value is 1

change. Any code relying on this controller is not guaranteed to
work in the future.
docend

sctrl	MoveHitReset
docbgn
Resets the movehit flag to 0. That is, after executing MoveHitReset, the triggers MoveContact, MoveGuarded, and MoveHit will all return 0.
docend

sctrl	NotHitBy
req	value	string
opt	time	0
docbgn
Temporarily specifies types of hits that are not allowed to hit the player.
The player has two hit attribute slots, which can be set using the
"value" or "value2" parameters to the NotHitBy controller. These
slots can also be set by the HitBy controller. When a slot is set,
it gets a timer (the effective time) which counts down toward zero.
If the timer has not yet reached zero, the slot is considered to be
active. The player can be hit by a HitDef only if that HitDef's
attribute appears in all currently active slots.
Using the NotHitBy controller sets the specified slot to contain all
hit attributes except those specified in the NotHitBy attribute
string.
docend

sctrl	Null

sctrl	ParentVarAdd
req	v	0
req	value	0
req	fv	0
req	value	0.0
docbgn
If the player is a helper, adds to one of the player's parent's working variables. Either a float variable or an int variable can be added to by this controller. If the player is not a helper, this controller does nothing.
Due to historical reasons, note that the alternate VarAdd
syntax listed above matches neither the syntax for variable
assignment within an expression, nor the syntax for variable
addition within an expression.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do
not use variable assignment within the custom states. Otherwise, you
will overwrite P2's parent's variables, which can cause unintended
malfunction of the opponent player.
Warning: System variables (sysvar, sysfvar) cannot be used within this controller.
docend

sctrl	ParentVarSet
req	v	0
req	value	0
req	fv	0
req	value	0.0
docbgn
If the player is a helper, sets one of the parent's working variables. Either a float variable or an int variable can be set by this controller. Does nothing if the player is not a helper.
Due to historical reasons, note that the alternate variable
assignment syntax listed above does not exactly match the syntax for
variable assignment within an expression.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do
not use variable assignment within the custom states. Otherwise, you

Executing a Pause during a superpause will delay the effects
of the pause until after the superpause has ended.
docend

sctrl	PlayerPush
req	value	0
docbgn
Disables the player's push checking for one tick. Push checking keeps players from overlapping one another. By temporarily disabling push checking, dodge-type moves in which the player passes through another (but can still be hit) can be implemented.

docend

sctrl	RemapPal
opt	source	0	0
opt	dest	0	0
docbgn
Changes one of the player's palettes to another.
Palette mappings are not transitive; i.e. mapping 1,0 to 2,0 and 2,0 to 3,0
will not map 1,0 to 3,0.
In 1.1 and newer, each player is allowed up to 8 different palette mappings
at the same time.
Subsequent calls of RemapPal will fail if the source pair is not already
being mapped.  Unused mappings can be removed by setting dst_pal_grp to -1
for a given source pair.

sctrl	ReversalDef
req	reversal.attr	string
docbgn
Defines a reversal. If one of P2's Clns1 boxes comes in contact with one of P1's Clsn1 boxes and a ReversalDef is active, then P1 will reverse P2's attack. Use with p1stateno (and optionally p2stateno) for creating reversal attacks.
ReversalDefs take the HitDef parameters pausetime, sparkno, hitsound, p1stateno, and p2stateno, plus:
The sparkxy parameter is treated as an offset to P2's hitdef's sparkxy. The MoveHit trigger can be used to detect if P1 successfully reversed P2.
docend

sctrl	ScreenBound

docbgn
This trigger takes three arguments. The first argument is a condition argument.
If the condition is true (i.e., nonzero), Cond evaluates and returns the second
argument. If the condition is false, Cond evaluates and returns the third
argument. If the condition is bottom, then Cond returns bottom without
evaluating the second or third arguments. In all cases, any unused argument(s) are not evaluated. Therefore, Cond can be
used instead of IfElse to avoid any side effects that would be caused by
evaluating the unused argument (e.g., variable assignment, or performing a
computation that would cause bottom to be generated).
docend

trigger	IfElse (math)
fmt	IfElse("","","")
docbgn
This trigger takes three arguments. If the first is nonzero, IfElse returns the
value of the second argument. Else, it returns the value of the third argument.
All arguments are evaluated prior to execution of IfElse. In particular, any
side effects caused by evaluation of the arguments (such as variable
assignment, or performing a computation that generates a warning) will occur.
If you wish to avoid these side effects, then use Cond.
docend

trigger	HitPauseTime
fmt	HitPauseTime
docbgn

sctrl	Dialogue	ikgo
docbgn
Assigns a dialogue data to be displayed either right before lifebar calls fight during first round (last frame of RoundState = 1) or at the last active frame of the final round (RoundState = 4, right before screen starts fading out). If more than 1 player calls this sctrl, who will end up initiating dialogue is chosen randomly.
How the rendered dialogue will look like (positioning, default face sprites, background definition, default time between text etc.) is controlled by `[Dialogue Info]` screenpack parameters (refer to system.def distributed with engine for a working example). By default player who called the state controller will use screenpack parameters prefixed with *p1* and his *enemy(0)* will be assigned to use *p2* parameters (this is adjustable via text tokens).
With appropriate screenpack parameters it's possible to skip to the next *text* parameter during dialogue via button press, without ending it all together. If this screenpack group is missing, dialogue won't be initiated at all (`enabled` parameter defaults to 0).
Tokens prefixed with *pX* (where X is 1 or 2) refers to screenpack `[Dialogue Info]` parameters prefixed the same way. Some tokens accepts *redirection* argument that points to which player assets (sprite, sound, anim, state) should be used.

docend

sctrl	AssertInput	ikgo
docbgn
This controller allows you to assert up to three input flags simultaneously via single sctrl. Similarly to AssertSpecial, there is no limit how many times this controller is called. Each flag will be automatically "de-asserted" at every game tick, so you must assert a flag for each tick that you want it to be active. Ikemen interprets input flags the same was as if corresponding input keys were pressed.
docend
opt	flag2

docend

trigger	AiLevelF	ikgo
fmt	AILevelF
docbgn
Returns the difficulty level of the player's AI as float value (unlike *AILevel* trigger, which is still floored for compatibility reasons). If AI is enabled on the player, the value ranges from 1 (easiest) to 8 (most difficult). If AI is not enabled on the player, the return value is 0. AI difficulty level with floating point is a result of AI Ramping system (refer to select.def distributed with engine for more information)
docend

trigger	TeamSize	ikgo
fmt	TeamSize

docend

trigger	StageTime	ikgo
fmt	StageTime
docbgn
Returns the amount of ticks since the last stage background reset. Value returned by this trigger corresponds directly to amount of times stage backgrounds have been updated (taking into account pause, super pause, as well as `resetbg` stage parameter), which allows to reliably synchronize [attachedchar](Stage-features/#info_attachedchar) actions to what's currently displayed by stage.
docend

trigger	P8Name	ikgo
fmt	P8Name = ""
docbgn
Same as P1Name-P4Name, except that these return the name of other team members, if present. If there is no such opponent, then it returns 0 no matter what name is specified. Similarly, P5Name != "name" will return 1 no matter what name is specified.

docbgn
Checks the attribute parameter of the player's currently-active ReversalDef. If the player does not currently have an active ReversalDef, then no parameters will match. Can be used for AI to detect a counter or to code something to happen if it exists.
ReversalDefAttr!= value1, value2 is logically equivalent to !(ReversalDefAttr= value1, value2).
docend

trigger	TeamLeader	ikgo
fmt	TeamLeader
docbgn
Returns [playerno](Triggers/#new_playerno) of the character that is considered a team leader. In modes where only one player is controlled in particular round (*single*, *turns* and *ratio*) it will be either 1 or 2, depending on team side. In *simul* and *tag* modes, team leader is the first party member (again 1 or 2) by default, but who is considered a leader can be also dynamically adjusted via optional [TagIn](State-controllers/#new_tagin) sctrl *leader* parameter.
Manually swapping leader changes lifebar elements assignment - leader always uses P1 (or P2, depending on team side) lifebar elements, remaining players positions are moved accordingly, in ascending players order.
docend

trigger	SprPriority	ikgo
fmt	SprPriority
docbgn
Returns the player's/helper's current SprPriority value.
