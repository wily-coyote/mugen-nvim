sctrl	AssertSpecial
req	flag	string
opt	flag2	string
opt	flag3	string
docbgn
This controller allows you to assert up to three special flags simultaneously. MUGEN will automatically "deassert" each flag at every game tick, so you must assert a flag for each tick that you want it to be active.

The flag name can be one of the following:

intro
Tells MUGEN that the character is currently performing his intro pose. Must be
asserted on every tick while the intro pose is being performed.

invisible
Turns the character invisible while asserted. Does not affect display of
afterimages.

roundnotover
Tells MUGEN that the character is currently performing his win pose. Should be
asserted on every tick while the win pose is being performed.

nobardisplay
Disables display of life, super bars, etc. while asserted.

noBG
Turns off the background. The screen is cleared to black.

noFG
Disables display of layer 1 of the stage (the foreground).

nostandguard
While asserted, disables standing guard for the character.

nocrouchguard
While asserted, disables crouching guard for the character.

noairguard
While asserted, disables air guard for the character.

noautoturn
While asserted, keeps the character from automatically turning
to face the opponent.

nojugglecheck
While asserted, disables juggle checking. P2 can be juggled
regardless of juggle points.

nokosnd
Suppresses playback of sound 11, 0 (the KO sound) for players
who are knocked out. For players whose KO sound echoes, nokosnd
must be asserted for 50 or more ticks after the player is KOed
in order to suppress all echoes.

nokoslow
While asserted, keeps MUGEN from showing the end of the round in slow motion.

noshadow
While asserted, disables display of this player's shadows.

globalnoshadow
Disables display of all player, helper and explod shadows.

nomusic
While asserted, pauses playback of background music.

nowalk
While asserted, the player cannot enter his walk states, even if he has
control. Use to prevent run states from canceling into walking.

timerfreeze
While asserted, keeps the round timer from counting down. Useful to keep the
round from timing over in the middle of a splash screen.

unguardable
While asserted, all the asserting player's HitDefs become unblockable, i.e.,
their guardflags are ignored.

In Ikemen-GO, AssertSpecial has new flag names:

AnimateHitpause (nightly build only)
While asserted, this flag makes the player's animation advance normally even during a hitpause.

AnimFreeze
While asserted, the player's animation will be frozen on the current frame.

AutoGuard
While asserted, makes the player guard automatically, without need to press back direction. The player will also switch automatically between standing and crouching guard.

DrawUnder (nightly build only)
While asserted, makes the player sprites be drawn with the same properties of Explod under parameter. That is, if the player is on layer 0, it will always be drawn behind lifebars and character shadows.

GlobalNoKo
While asserted all players won't die from taking damage.

NoAiLevel
While asserted, makes the player AILevel and AILevelF triggers return 0

NoAirJump
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 45 when Ctrl=1 && StateType=A && Command="holdup" and AirJump.Num allows

NoBrake
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 0 when StateNo=20 && Command!="holdfwd" && Command!="holdback"

NoCrouch
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 10 when Ctrl=1 && StateType=S && Command="holddown".

NoDizzyPointsDamage
While asserted, player won't be affected by a HitDef's dizzypoints parameter.

NoFastRecoverFromLieDown
Disables the hard-coded faster recover from lie down on key input mashing when StateType=L && GetHitVar(RecoverTime)>0.

NoFallCount
Disables the hard-coded FallCount increment when StateNo=5070 || StateNo=5100.

NoFallDefenceUp
Disables the hard-coded defence increase when StateNo=5070 || StateNo=5100.

NoFallHitflag (nightly build only)
While asserted, every HitDef will act as if its HitFlag has no F parameter. In other words, the player becomes unable to hit falling enemies.

NoGetUpFromLieDown
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 5120 when StateNo=5110 && GetHitVar(RecoverTime)=0.

NoGuardKo
While asserted player won't die from taking chip damage.

NoGuardDamage
While asserted, player won't be affected by HitDef damage guard_damage.

NoGuardPointsDamage
While asserted, player won't be affected by HitDef guardpoints.

NoFightDisplay (nightly build only)
While asserted, the "fight" announcement on round start will be skipped.

NoHardcodedKeys
Disables the hard-coded state transitions when pressing directional keys (combination of NoJump, NoAirJump, NoCrouch, NoStand, NoWalk, NoBrake, NoStandGuard, NoCrouchGuard, NoAirGuard).

NoHitDamage
While asserted, player won't be affected by HitDef damage hit_damage.

NoInput
While asserted, makes the player ignore any player/CPU inputs.

NoIntroReset
While asserted, prevents a player from being forced to their starting position after the round number announcement.

NoJump
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 40 when Ctrl=1 && StateType=S && Command="holdup"

NoKo
While asserted, the player won't die from taking damage.
If ikemenversion is not 0, the NoKO flag affects only the player that called it. Otherwise, the MUGEN behavior is replicated, and all players are affected. The new GlobalNoKo flag can be used to replicate the old MUGEN behavior.

NoKoDisplay (nightly build only)
While asserted, the KO announcement on round end will be skipped.

NoKoVelocity
While asserted, player won't be affected by HitDef velocity adjustments upon KO.

NoMakeDust
While asserted, the player does not generate hardcoded dust effects. The MakeDust state controller will also have no effect.

NoPowerBarDisplay
While asserted, disables displaying powerbars by this playerno (with team power share option enabled and/or lifebar design with only 1 powerbar per side, the flag has to be asserted on team leader to disable powerbar rendering for whole team).

NoRedLifeDamage (nightly build only)
While asserted, player won't be affected by HitDef redlife.

NoRoundDisplay (nightly build only)
While asserted, the round number announcement on round start will be skipped.

NoStand
Disables the hard-coded state transitions to State 12 when StateType=C && Command!="holddown".

NoTurnTarget
While asserted, keeps the opponent from automatically turning to face the player.

NoWinDisplay (nightly build only)
While asserted, the winner announcement on round end will be skipped.

PostRoundInput
While asserted, player's inputs are not disabled post-match (RoundState>2 || RoundState=-1).

ProjTypeCollision (nightly build only)
While asserted, the player will clash with projectiles (and other players with the same flag) if their Clsn2 boxes overlap. This allows helpers to easily replicate this kind of projectile clashing.

RoundFreeze
While asserted, round related lifebar actions and internal timers are frozen (allows maintaining current roundstate).

RoundNotSkip
Disables intro and victory pose skipping via button press.

RunFirst (nightly build only)
While asserted, makes the player code be processed before that of any other players.

RunLast (nightly build only)
While asserted, makes the player code be processed after all other players.

SizePushOnly (nightly build only)
In Ikemen, like Mugen, characters will push each other when both their size boxes (width * height) and their Clsn2 boxes overlap. Asserting this flag makes it so that only the size boxes are checked, as in most fighting games.
docend

sctrl	AttackDist
req	value	0
docbgn
Changes the value of the guard.dist parameter for the player's current HitDef. The guard.dist is the x-distance from P1 in which P2 will go
into a guard state if P2 is holding the direction away from P1.
The effect of guard.dist only takes effect when P1 has movetype = A.

In Ikemen-GO, value takes a second number. This number sets the distance that a player can attack behind the enemy and still allow them to enter proximity guard.

docbgn
The Explod controller is a flexible tool for displaying animations such as sparks, dust and other visual effects. Its functionality includes that of GameMakeAnim, which is now deprecated.
The position of an explod that is bound to a player is determined only after
all player updates have completed (compared to helpers, which are created
relative to the player's immediate position when the controller was executed).
This behavior is necessary to make explods bind properly to the player's
screen position.
For example, assume the player has an x velocity of 5 and a position of (160,0).
If an explod is created with an offset of 0,0 relative to p1, then the explod's
actual screen position will be 165,0.

sctrl	FallEnvShake
docbgn
Shakes the screen using the fall.envshake parameters set by an attack (see HitDef controller). This controller is effective only if GetHitVar(fall.envshake.time) is not zero, and it sets GetHitVar(fall.envshake.time) to zero after being executed. This controller is used in common1.cns to shake the screen when a player falls, and is not normally useful otherwise.

docbgn
Temporarily specifies the types of hits that are be allowed hit to the player.
The player has two hit attribute slots, which can be set using the
value or value2 parameters to the HitBy controller. These slots can
also be set by the NotHitBy controller. When a slot is set, it gets
a timer (the effective time) which counts down toward zero. If the
timer has not yet reached zero, the slot is considered to be active.
The player can be hit by a HitDef only if that HitDef's attribute
appears in all currently active slots.
Using the HitBy controller sets the specified slot to contain only
those hit attributes which appear in the HitBy attribute string.

In Ikemen-GO, this controller accepts the same syntax as HitOverride.

This is one of the more complex, but most commonly-used controllers.
A single HitDef is valid only for a single hit. To make a move hit several times, you must trigger more than one HitDef during the attack.
The behavior of HitDef is undefined when executed from a
[Statedef -2] block while the player has another player's

Modifies the parameters of an existing Explod. Syntax is basically
the same as Explod. However, this controller is subject to future
change. Any code relying on this controller is not guaranteed to
work in the future.

sctrl	MoveHitReset
docbgn
Resets the movehit flag to 0. That is, after executing MoveHitReset, the triggers MoveContact, MoveGuarded, and MoveHit will all return 0.
docend

sctrl	NotHitBy
req	value	string
opt	time	0
opt	Attr	0
opt	Slot	0
opt	Stack	0
opt	PlayerNo	0
opt	PlayerID	0
docbgn
Temporarily specifies types of hits that are not allowed to hit the player.
The player has two hit attribute slots, which can be set using the
"value" or "value2" parameters to the NotHitBy controller. These
slots can also be set by the HitBy controller. When a slot is set,
it gets a timer (the effective time) which counts down toward zero.
If the timer has not yet reached zero, the slot is considered to be
active. The player can be hit by a HitDef only if that HitDef's
attribute appears in all currently active slots.
Using the NotHitBy controller sets the specified slot to contain all
hit attributes except those specified in the NotHitBy attribute
string.

In Ikemen-GO, this controller accepts the same syntax as HitOverride.
docend

sctrl	Null
docbgn
Does nothing. May be used for disabling other state controllers by changing their type to Null.
Any triggers associated with the controller will still be evaluated.
docend

sctrl	Offset
opt	x	0.0
opt	y	0.0
docbgn
Changes the player's display offset. The player is drawn shifted from his axis by this amount.

sctrl	ParentVarAdd
req	v	0
req	fv	0
req	value	0
opt	var($var_no)	0
opt	fvar($var_no)	0.0
docbgn
If the player is a helper, adds to one of the player's parent's working variables. Either a float variable or an int variable can be added to by this controller. If the player is not a helper, this controller does nothing.
Due to historical reasons, note that the alternate VarAdd
syntax listed above matches neither the syntax for variable
assignment within an expression, nor the syntax for variable
addition within an expression.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do
not use variable assignment within the custom states. Otherwise, you
will overwrite P2's parent's variables, which can cause unintended
malfunction of the opponent player.
Warning: System variables (sysvar, sysfvar) cannot be used within this controller.

If the player is a helper, sets one of the parent's working variables. Either a float variable or an int variable can be set by this controller. Does nothing if the player is not a helper.
Due to historical reasons, note that the alternate variable
assignment syntax listed above does not exactly match the syntax for
variable assignment within an expression.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do
not use variable assignment within the custom states. Otherwise, you

sctrl	Pause
req	time	0
opt	endcmdbuftime	0
opt	movetime	0
opt	pausebg	0
docbgn
Pauses the game for the specified amount of time. Player and background updates are not carried out during this time.
Executing a Pause controller during the pausetime of another
will cancel out the effect of the previous Pause controller.
Executing a Pause during a superpause will delay the effects
of the pause until after the superpause has ended.
docend

sctrl	PlayerPush
req	value	0
opt	Priority	0
docbgn
Disables the player's push checking for one tick. Push checking keeps players from overlapping one another. By temporarily disabling push checking, dodge-type moves in which the player passes through another (but can still be hit) can be implemented.

docbgn
Creates a projectile for the player. The Projectile controller takes all the parameters of the HitDef controller, which control the HitDef for the projectile. In addition, Projectile has the following additional parameters:
All projectiles created by helpers immediately become owned by the root.
The behavior of a projectile's HitDef is undefined when executed from a
[Statedef -2] block while the player has another player's
state and animation data.
docend

sctrl	RemapPal
opt	source	0	0
opt	dest	0	0
docbgn
Changes one of the player's palettes to another.
Palette mappings are not transitive; i.e. mapping 1,0 to 2,0 and 2,0 to 3,0
will not map 1,0 to 3,0.
In 1.1 and newer, each player is allowed up to 8 different palette mappings
at the same time.
Subsequent calls of RemapPal will fail if the source pair is not already
being mapped.  Unused mappings can be removed by setting dst_pal_grp to -1
for a given source pair.
docend

sctrl	RemoveExplod
opt	ID	0
docbgn
Removes all of a player's explods, or just the explods with a specified ID number.
docend

sctrl	ReversalDef
req	reversal.attr	string
docbgn
Defines a reversal. If one of P2's Clns1 boxes comes in contact with one of P1's Clsn1 boxes and a ReversalDef is active, then P1 will reverse P2's attack. Use with p1stateno (and optionally p2stateno) for creating reversal attacks.
ReversalDefs take the HitDef parameters pausetime, sparkno, hitsound, p1stateno, and p2stateno, plus:
The sparkxy parameter is treated as an offset to P2's hitdef's sparkxy. The MoveHit trigger can be used to detect if P1 successfully reversed P2.
docend

sctrl	ScreenBound
opt	value	0
opt	movecamera	0	0
opt	StageBound	0
docbgn
Specifies whether or not the player's movement should be constrained to the screen or not. Also determines whether the camera should move to follow the player or not. The results of this controller are valid for 1 tick.
docend

sctrl	SelfState
req	value	0
opt	ctrl	0
opt	anim	0
opt	Continue	0
opt	ReadPlayerID	0
docbgn
Like ChangeState, except that this changes a player back to a state in his own state data. Use this when you have placed an opponent player in a custom state via an attack, and wish to restore the opponent to his own states.
docend

sctrl	SprPriority
req	value	0
opt	LayerNo	0
docbgn

opt	pos	0.0
opt	darken	0
opt	p2defmul	0.0
opt	poweradd	0
opt	unhittable	0
docbgn
Freezes the gameplay and darkens the screen. While each player is frozen, no time passes for them. Use for a dramatic pause during the start of hyper attacks.
If the Pause controller was previously executed, and the action is
still paused, executing a SuperPause will preempt the Pause
controller's effects. During the SuperPause, the time left until
the Pause controller's effects expires will not count down.
docend

sctrl	TargetBind

sctrl	VarAdd
req	v	0
req	fv	0
req	value	0
opt	var($var_no)	0
opt	fvar($var_no)	0.0
docbgn
Adds to one of the player's working variables. Either a float variable or an int variable can be added to by this controller.
Due to historical reasons, note that the alternate VarAdd
syntax listed above matches neither the syntax for variable
assignment within an expression, nor the syntax for variable
addition within an expression.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do
not use variable assignment within the custom states. Otherwise, you
will overwrite P2's variables, which can cause unintended
malfunction of the opponent player.
docend

sctrl	VarRandom
req	v	0
opt	range	0
docbgn
Sets the specified int variable to a random value. Float variables cannot be set by this controller.
If you have placed P2 in a custom state through a successful hit, do

docend

sctrl	VictoryQuote
opt	value	0
docbgn
Selects a victory quote from the player to display in the next victory screen.
This controller can be called by any player at any time during a match; however
only the winning player will affect the quote that is shown.
This controller only affects the victory screen immediately following the current match.
This controller has no effect if executed by a helper.
The actual victory quotes are specified in the [Quotes] group of the player's constants file.
docend

sctrl	Width
opt	edge	0	0
opt	player	0	0
opt	value	0	0
docbgn
Temporarily changes the size of the player's width bar for 1 tick. Useful for controlling the "pushing" behavior when the player makes contact with another or with the sides of the screen.
When collision box display is enabled, the edge width bar is
displayed in orange, and the player width bar is displayed in
yellow. Where they overlap, the overlapping region is displayed in
bright yellow.
docend

sctrl	Zoom
opt	scale	0
opt	pos	0
opt	lag	0
opt	CameraBound	0
opt	StageBound	0

Zoom was a beta feature in Mugen 1.1. It is a fully functional state controller in Ikemen GO.  
docend

trigger	Abs
fmt	abs($exprn)
docbgn
Computes the absolute value of its argument.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	Acos
fmt	acos($exprn)
docbgn
Computes the arccosine (in radians) of the specified argument.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom, or if exprn is not in
the domain of arccosine (which is [-1.0,1.0]).
docend

trigger	AILevel
fmt	AILevel
docbgn
Returns the difficulty level of the player's AI.
If AI is enabled on the player, the value ranges from 1 (easiest) to 8 (most difficult).
If AI is not enabled on the player, the return value is 0.
docend

trigger	Alive
fmt	alive
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player is still able to fight, 0 if the player has been KOed.
docend

trigger	Anim
fmt	Anim
docbgn
Returns the current animation action number of the player.
docend

trigger	AnimElem
fmt	AnimElem = $value1, = $value2
docbgn
Gets the animation-time elapsed since the start of a specified element of the current animation action. Useful for synchronizing events to elements of an animation action.
(reminder: first element of an action is element 1, not 0)
AnimElemTime has similar functionality to AnimElem, but can take expressions as its argument.
Returns bottom if the specified element number is invalid for this
action (e.g., it's too large or too small).
Trigger in Format 1 is true if the player's animation is
at the start of the element number specified by value1.
In other words, if value1 is equal to n, it is true on the
first game-tick of the nth element of the animation.
Trigger in Format 2 compares the player's animation-time
to t+value2, where t is time of the start of the element
number specified by value1.

AnimElem will not trigger on the first game-tick of the second or
later loop of an animation with a finite looptime. For example,
"AnimElem = 1" will trigger the first tick a player changes to an
animation, but will not trigger on the tick that it loops. You may
get it to trigger each time using "AnimElem = 1 || AnimTime = 0".
docend

trigger	AnimElemNo
fmt	AnimElemNo($exprn)
docbgn
Returns the number of the animation element in the current action
that would be displayed at the specified time. The argument to AnimElemNo represents the time to check, expressed in game ticks, relative to the present.
Returns bottom if you try to check a time that would fall before the
start of the current action.
If the action is currently within its looping portion, then it is
assumed to have been looping forever. That is, no matter how far into
the past you check, AnimElemNo will always return an element number
that lies within the looping portion of the action.
docend

trigger	AnimElemTime
fmt	AnimElemTime($exprn)
docbgn
Gets the animation-time elapsed since the start of a specified element of the current animation action. Useful for synchronizing events to elements of an animation action.
(reminder: first element of an action is element 1, not 0)
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom, or if exprn evaluates
to an element number that is not valid for the current action.
AnimElemTime will not trigger on the first game-tick of the second or later loop of an animation with a finite looptime. For example, "AnimElemTime(1) = 0" will trigger the first tick a player changes to an animation, but will not trigger on the tick that it loops. You may get it to trigger each time using "AnimElemTime(1) = 0 || AnimTime = 0".
docend

trigger	AnimExist
fmt	AnimExist($exprn)
docbgn
Returns 1 if the specified animation action exists for the player.
The result of this trigger is undefined if the player has been placed in a custom state by a successful hit. In this situation, use SelfAnimExist.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	AnimTime
fmt	AnimTime
docbgn
Gives the difference between the looptime of the current animation action and the player's animation-time. Useful for knowing when the end of the animation has been reached. (Animation-time is the time in game-ticks that the player has spent within the current animation action.)
The name may be confusing. Try to think of it as "time from the end of the animation". During the animation, AnimTime will always return a non-positive number.
docend

trigger	Asin
fmt	asin($exprn)
docbgn
Computes the arcsine (in radians) of the specified argument.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom, or if exprn is not in
the domain of arcsine (which is [-1.0,1.0]).
docend

trigger	Atan
fmt	atan($exprn)
docbgn
Computes the arctangent (in radians) of the specified argument.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	AuthorName
fmt	AuthorName = "$name"
docbgn
Returns the player's author's name (specified in the .DEF file). This may also be useful for telling apart characters with the same name but different authors.
docend

trigger	BackEdge
fmt	BackEdge
docbgn
BackEdge returns the x position of the edge of the screen that is behind the player, in absolute stage coordinates.
This trigger is equivalent to the expression "ifelse(facing = 1, LeftEdge, RightEdge)".
docend

trigger	BackEdgeBodyDist
fmt	BackEdgeBodyDist
docbgn
BackEdgeBodyDist gives the distance from the back of the player, as determined by the end of his width bar, to the back edge of the screen.
docend

trigger	BackEdgeDist
fmt	BackEdgeDist
docbgn
BackEdgeDist gives the distance between the x-axis of the player and the edge of the screen behind of the player.
docend

trigger	BottomEdge
fmt	BottomEdge
docbgn
BottomEdge returns the y position of the bottom edge of the screen, in absolute stage coordinates.
This trigger is equivalent to the expression "Pos Y - ScreenPos Y + GameHeight".
docend

trigger	CameraPos
fmt	CameraPos $X
docbgn
Gets the value of the camera's position relative to the stage.
The home position of the camera is 0, 0.
The value of "CameraPos X" increases as the camera moves to the right.
The value of "CameraPos Y" decreases as the camera moves upwards.
The units of the position returned is in the coordspace of the player.
docend

trigger	CameraZoom
fmt	CameraZoom
docbgn
Gets the value of the camera's zoom factor.
The zoom factor de
docend

trigger	CanRecover
fmt	CanRecover
docbgn
If the player is currently in a falling state, returns 1 if he is currently able to recover, and 0 if he is not currently able to recover. If the player is not currently falling, the output of this trigger is undefined.
docend

trigger	Ceil
fmt	ceil($exprn)
docbgn
Implements the "ceiling" function. Returns the least integer which is greater than or equal to the specified argument.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	Command
fmt	Command = "$command_name"
docbgn
Triggers if the user has input the specified command.

In Ikemen-GO, if a character has ikemenversion, when the Command trigger is
redirected to another player, the engine will first check if the other player
is performing its own command with the same name. If not, it'll check if it's
performing the command from our own command list. Otherwise it will work like
Mugen.
docend

trigger	Cond
fmt	Cond($exp_cond,$exp_true,$exp_false)
docbgn
This trigger takes three arguments. The first argument is a condition argument.
If the condition is true (i.e., nonzero), Cond evaluates and returns the second
argument. If the condition is false, Cond evaluates and returns the third
argument. If the condition is bottom, then Cond returns bottom without
evaluating the second or third arguments.
In all cases, any unused argument(s) are not evaluated. Therefore, Cond can be
used instead of IfElse to avoid any side effects that would be caused by
evaluating the unused argument (e.g., variable assignment, or performing a
computation that would cause bottom to be generated).
Returns bottom if exp_cond evaluates to bottom, or if exp_true or exp_false
(whichever is actually used) evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	Const
fmt	Const($param_name)
docbgn
Returns the value of one of the player's constants.
none
docend

trigger	Const240p
fmt	Const240p($exprn)
docbgn
Converts a value from the 240p coordinate space to the player's coordinate space.
The conversion ratio between coordinate spaces is the ratio of their widths.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
Non-zero position and velocity offset values in common1.cns should use one of
the Const triggers to maintain consistency with characters from a different
coordinate space.
docend

trigger	Const480p
fmt	Const480p($exprn)
docbgn
Converts a value from the 480p coordinate space to the player's coordinate space.
The conversion ratio between coordinate spaces is the ratio of their widths.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
Non-zero position and velocity offset values in common1.cns should use one of
the Const triggers to maintain consistency with characters from a different
coordinate space.
docend

trigger	Const720p
fmt	Const720p($exprn)
docbgn
Converts a value from the 720p coordinate space to the player's coordinate space.
The conversion ratio between coordinate spaces is the ratio of their widths.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
Non-zero position and velocity offset values in common1.cns should use one of
the Const triggers to maintain consistency with characters from a different
coordinate space.
docend

Returns the value of e (2.718281828...)
docend

trigger	Exp
fmt	exp($exprn)
docbgn
Computes the exponential of the argument (e raised to the power of
the argument.) This produces slightly more accurate results than the
equivalent expression e**(argument).
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	Facing
fmt	Facing
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player is facing to the right, and -1 if the player is facing to the left.

FrontEdge returns the x position of the edge of the screen that is in front the player, in absolute stage coordinates.
This trigger is equivalent to the expression "ifelse(facing = 1, RightEdge, LeftEdge)".
docend

trigger	FrontEdgeBodyDist
fmt	FrontEdgeBodyDist
docbgn
FrontEdgeBodyDist gives the distance between the front of the player (as determined by the front edge of his width bar) and the edge of the screen.

docbgn
FrontEdgeDist gives the distance between the x-axis of the player and the edge of the screen in front of the player.
docend

trigger	FVar
fmt	FVar($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes a mandatory variable number as an argument. It returns the value of the player's specified float variable.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom, or if exprn evaluates
to an invalid variable index.
docend

trigger	GameHeight
fmt	GameHeight
docbgn
Returns the current height of the game space in the player's local coordinate space.
The game space is defined as the currently-visible area of the stage in which players interact.
The dimensions of the game space at a zoom factor of 1.0 is specified by the
GameWidth and GameHeight parameters in mugen.cfg.
GameWidth and GameHeight scale inversely with the zoom factor of the camera.
For example, if the camera zoom factor is 0.5, the values returned by GameWidth
and GameHeight will be double that of at zoom factor 1.
ScreenWidth and ScreenHeight are the equivalent triggers that are not
affected by the camera zoom factor.
In Ikemen-GO, if MugenVersion is specified as 1.0 in character's [Info] section, GameHeight returns the same value as ScreenHeight.
docend

trigger	GameTime
fmt	GameTime
docbgn
Returns the total number of ticks that have elapsed in the game so far.
docend

trigger	GameWidth
fmt	GameWidth
docbgn
Returns the current width of the game space in the player's local coordinate space.
The game space is defined as the currently-visible area of the stage in which players interact.
The dimensions of the game space at a zoom factor of 1.0 is specified by the
GameWidth and GameHeight parameters in mugen.cfg.
GameWidth and GameHeight scale inversely with the zoom factor of the camera.
For example, if the camera zoom factor is 0.5, the values returned by GameWidth
and GameHeight will be double that of at zoom factor 1.
ScreenWidth and ScreenHeight are the equivalent triggers that are not
affected by the camera zoom factor.

In Ikemen-GO, if MugenVersion is specified as 1.0 in character's [Info] section, GameWidth returns the same value as ScreenWidth.

docend

trigger	HitCount
fmt	HitCount
docbgn
Returns the number times the player's current attack move has hit one or more opponents. This value is valid only for a single state; after any state change, it resets to 0. To prevent it from resetting to 0, set hitcountpersist in the StateDef (see cns documentation for details). The HitCount and UniqHitCount triggers differ only when the player is hitting more than one opponent. In the case where the player is hitting two opponents with the same attack, HitCount will increase by 1 for every hit, while UniqHitCount increases by 2.
docend

trigger	HitDefAttr
docbgn
Checks the attribute parameter of the player's currently-active HitDef.
If the player is not currently attacking, then no parameters will match.
Can be used for simple move-interrupts from weaker to stronger attacks in the CMD file.
Note:HitDefAttr != value1, value2is logically equivalent to!(HitDefAttr = value1, value2).
docend

trigger	HitFall
fmt	HitFall
docbgn
If the player is currently in a gethit state, returns the fall flag of the hit. The output of this trigger is undefined if the player is not in a gethit state. For an explanation of the fall flag, see the HitDef documentation.
docend

trigger	HitOver
fmt	HitOver
docbgn
If the player is in a gethit state, returns 1 when the hittime has expired, and 0 otherwise. For an explanation of hittime, see the HitDef documentation.
docend

trigger	HitPauseTime
fmt	HitPauseTime
docbgn
Returns the time until the player's hitpause expires. The player enters a hitpause when his attack comes in contact with an opponent. The initial hitpause time is equal to the first value of the pausetime parameter in the player's HitDef. If ignorehitpause is not set, this will always return 0.
docend

trigger	HitShakeOver
fmt	HitShakeOver
docbgn
If the player is in a gethit state, returns 1 if the hit shake (the period when he is shaking in place) has ended, and 0 otherwise.
docend

trigger	HitVel
fmt	HitVel $X
docbgn
Gets the value of the velocity imparted to the player by a hit.
You must specify the component that you want to check, eg.
"HitVel Y" to check the vertical velocity component.
A positive HitVel Y means that the player is moving upward on the
screen. A positive HitVel X means that the player is moving
backward. Note that the HitVel X trigger behaves in the opposite
manner to the Vel X trigger.
docend

trigger	ID
fmt	ID
docbgn
Returns the ID number of the player. The ID number is unique for every player throughout the course of a match. Any helper that is created during this time will also receive its own unique ID number. This trigger may be useful for getting opponents' ID numbers, to be later used with the "playerID" redirection keyword (see exp docs). Do not confuse playerID with targetID.
docend

trigger	IfElse
fmt	IfElse($exp_cond,$exp_true,$exp_false)
docbgn
This trigger takes three arguments. If the first is nonzero, IfElse returns the
value of the second argument. Else, it returns the value of the third argument.
All arguments are evaluated prior to execution of IfElse. In particular, any
side effects caused by evaluation of the arguments (such as variable
assignment, or performing a computation that generates a warning) will occur.
If you wish to avoid these side effects, then use Cond.
Returns bottom if exp_cond evaluates to bottom, or if exp_true or exp_false (whichever is returned) evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	InGuardDist
fmt	InGuardDist
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player is within guarding distance of an opponent's physical or projectile attack. The guarding distance is the value of the guard.dist parameter of the opponent's HitDef. Returns 0 if out of guard distance, or the opponent is not attacking.
docend

trigger	IsHelper
fmt	IsHelper($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an optional ID number as an argument. If the ID number is omitted, IsHelper returns 1 if the player is a helper character, and 0 otherwise. If the ID number is included, then IsHelper returns 1 if the player is a helper character with the specified ID number, and 0 otherwise.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	IsHomeTeam

docend

trigger	LeftEdge
fmt	LeftEdge
docbgn
LeftEdge returns the x position of the left edge of the screen, in absolute stage coordinates.

docend

trigger	Life
fmt	Life
docbgn
Returns the player's life.
docend

trigger	LifeMax
fmt	LifeMax
docbgn

docend

trigger	Ln
fmt	ln($exprn)
docbgn
Returns the natural logarithm of its argument. This produces slightly more accurate results than the otherwise equivalent expression log(e,(argument)).
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom, or if exprn is not
positive.
docend

trigger	Log
fmt	Log($exp1,$exp2)
docbgn
Takes two arguments a and b, and returns the base-a logarithm of b.
Returns bottom if either of exp1 or exp2 evaluates to bottom, or if
either of exp1 or exp2 is not positive.
docend

trigger	Lose
fmt	Lose
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player (or the player's team, in team mode) has lost the round, 0 otherwise. Can be suffixed with "KO" or "Time" to return 1 only when the round has been lost by a KO or by time expiring, respectively.
docend

trigger	LoseKO
fmt	LoseKO
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player (or the player's team, in team mode) has lost the round, 0 otherwise. Can be suffixed with "KO" or "Time" to return 1 only when the round has been lost by a KO or by time expiring, respectively.
docend

trigger	LoseTime
fmt	LoseTime
docbgn
Returns 1 if the player (or the player's team, in team mode) has lost the round, 0 otherwise. Can be suffixed with "KO" or "Time" to return 1 only when the round has been lost by a KO or by time expiring, respectively.
docend

trigger	MatchNo
fmt	MatchNo
docbgn
Returns the current match number.
The current match number is always 1 in versus-type modes. In Arcade and Team Arcade modes, the match number starts at 1 and increments every time a new match starts (does not increment on continue). If you finish the arcade mode and start a new game, the match number reverts to 1.
docend

trigger	MatchOver
fmt	MatchOver
docbgn
Returns 1 if the match has ended. (For example, in the case of a best-of-three match, this will return true when one of the players or teams has won two rounds.)
Currently, MatchOver does not return true until the players start
their win poses (state 180). This behavior may be subject to change
in future releases.
docend

trigger	MoveContact
fmt	MoveContact
docbgn
This trigger is valid only when the player is in an attack state.
MoveContact gives a non-zero value if P2 has either been hit, or has guarded P1's attack. It gives 0 otherwise. P1 is the player, and P2 is his opponent.
Typically used with the "StateNo" and "Command" triggers for detecting move-interrupts in the CMD file.
On attack contact, MoveContact returns 1. After contact, MoveContact's return value will increase by 1 for each game tick that P1 is not paused (P1 gets paused on contact; see pausetime parameter in HitDef controller). The values of MoveGuarded, MoveHit and MoveReversed increment in the same fashion.
Note 1: the values of MoveContact, MoveGuarded, MoveHit and MoveReversed are set simultaneously. For example, if one HitDef in a move hits successfully, MoveHit will return non-zero. If a following HitDef in the same move is guarded, MoveGuarded will return non-zero, and the other three triggers will return 0.
Note 2: the values of the four Move* triggers reset to 0 and stop incrementing after a state transition. See "movehitpersist" parameter for StateDefs (CNS docs) for how to override this behavior.
docend

trigger	MoveGuarded
fmt	MoveGuarded
docbgn
This trigger is valid only when the player is in an attack state.
MoveGuarded gives a non-zero value if P2 is guarding, or has guarded, P1's attack. It gives 0 otherwise. P1 is the player, and P2 is his opponent.
Typically used with the "StateNo" and "Command" triggers for detecting move-interrupts in the CMD file.
See Details section for MoveContact trigger.
docend

trigger	MoveHit
fmt	MoveHit
docbgn
This trigger is valid only when the player is in an attack state.

See Details section for MoveContact trigger.
docend

trigger	MoveType
fmt	MoveType = $move_type
docbgn

on StateDef in the CNS documentation for more details on MoveType.
Useful for "move interrupts" in the CMD file.
docend

trigger	MoveReversed
fmt	MoveReversed
docbgn
This trigger is valid only when the player is in an attack state.
MoveReversed gives a non-zero value if P1's attack has been reversed by P2. It gives 0 otherwise.
See Details section for MoveContact trigger.
docend

trigger	Name
fmt	Name = "$name"
docbgn
Returns the player's name (the internal name specified in the .DEF file, which may not be the same as the displayed name).
docend

trigger	NumEnemy
fmt	NumEnemy
docbgn
NumEnemy returns the number of opponents that exist. Neutral players and normal helpers are not considered opponents.
docend

trigger	NumExplod
fmt	NumExplod($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an ID number as an optional argument. If the ID number is omitted, NumExplod returns the number of explods owned by the player. If the ID number is included, then NumExplod returns the number of explods with that ID number that are owned by the player. The ID number must be greater than -1. An ID number of -1 or less will give the same behavior as if the ID number is omitted.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	NumHelper
fmt	NumHelper($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an ID number as an optional argument. If the ID number is omitted, then NumHelper returns the total number of helpers currently owned by the player. If the ID number is included, then NumHelper returns the total number of helpers with that ID number owned by the player. The ID number must be greater than 0. If the ID
number is 0 or less, then all helpers are counted.

bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	NumTarget
fmt	NumTarget($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an ID number as an optional argument. If the ID number is omitted, NumTarget returns the current number of targets for the player. If the ID number is included, then NumTarget returns the number of targets for the player which have that target ID number. The ID number must be greater than -1. An ID number of -1 or less will give the same behavior as if the ID number is omitted.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom.
docend

trigger	P1Name
docbgn
This is an alias for the Name trigger. See "Name".
docend

trigger	P2BodyDist
fmt	P2BodyDist $X
docbgn
Returns the distance of P2 from P1, where P1 is the player, and P2 is his opponent. P2BodyDist is useful in the CMD for cases where P1 has an attack that is different when performed close to P2.
For comparing the Y-distance, P2BodyDist gives the difference in the
heights of the players' Y-axes. A negative value means that P2 is
above P1.
For comparing the X-distance, P2BodyDist gives the
X-distance of P2's front from P1's front. So, if the
players are standing right next to each other, then
P2BodyDist is 0. Remember that you can set the width of
the player in "front.width", etc. under [Size] in the
player variables.
In Ikemen-GO, this trigger accepts both the Y and Z component.
For comparing the Y-distance, if the character has an ikemenversion,
P2BodyDist gives the distance between the size boxes of the two players.
For comparing the Z-distance, if there is overlap between the players'
Z width, it gives 0. Otherwise, it gives the distance between
their theoretical width boxes.
See also P2Dist.
docend

trigger	P2Dist
fmt	P2Dist $X
docbgn
Returns the distance of P2 from P1, where P1 is the player, and P2 is his opponent.
For comparing the Y-distance, P2Dist gives the difference in the
heights of the players' Y-axes. A negative value means that P2 is
above P1.
For comparing the X-distance, P2Dist gives the X-distance
of P2's axis from P1's axis. A positive value indicates P2
is in front of P1.
In Ikemen-GO, the P2Dist trigger now also accepts a Z argument. Returns the distance between the players in the Z axis.
See also P2BodyDist.
docend

trigger	P2Life
docbgn
Same as Life, except that this returns the opponent's life.
docend

trigger	P2MoveType
docbgn
Same as MoveType, except that this returns the opponent's movetype.
docend

trigger	P2Name
docbgn
Same as P1Name, except that this returns the name of the primary opponent (the opponent in versus mode, or the first opponent in team mode).
If there is no primary opponent, then p2name = "name" returns 0 no
matter what name is specified. Similarly, p2name != "name" will return 1 no matter what name is specified.
docend

trigger	P2StateNo
docbgn
Same as StateNo, except that this returns the opponent's state number.
Returns bottom if p2 does not exist. (For instance, if the round
has been won.)
docend

trigger	P2StateType
docbgn
Same as StateType, except that this returns the opponent's state type.
Returns bottom if p2 does not exist. (For instance, if the round
has been won.)
docend

trigger	P3Name
docbgn
Same as P1Name, except that this returns the name of the player's teammate, if present.
If there is no teammate, then p3name = "name" returns 0 no matter what name is specified. Similarly, p3name != "name" will return 1 no matter what name is specified.
docend

trigger	P4Name
docbgn
Same as P1Name, except that this returns the name of the secondary opponent, if present.
If there is no secondary opponent, then p4name = "name" returns 0 no matter what name is specified. Similarly, p4name != "name" will return 1 no matter what name is specified.
docend

trigger	PalNo
fmt	PalNo
docbgn
Returns the palette number of the player (i.e., the color scheme chosen for the character during character select.)

The palette ordering is specified in the character's def file.
If omitted, the default ordering is:
A  B  C  X  Y  Z A2 B2 C2 X2 Y2 Z2
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
docend

trigger	ParentDist
fmt	ParentDist $X
docbgn
This trigger is only valid for helper-type characters.
ParentDist returns the distance from the helper to its parent. It works similarly to P2Dist.
Returns bottom if the player does not have a parent (e.g., if the
parent was destroyed or KO'd).
For comparing the Y-distance, ParentDist gives the difference in the
heights of the players' Y-axes. A negative value means that the
parent is above its child.
For comparing the X-distance, ParentDist gives the X-distance
of the parent's axis from the child's axis. A positive value
indicates the parent is in front of the child.
In Ikemen-GO, the ParentDist trigger now also accepts a Z argument. Returns the distance between the helper and its parent in the Z axis.
docend

trigger	Pi
fmt	pi
docbgn
This trigger returns the numeric value of pi (3.141593...)
docend

trigger	Pos
fmt	Pos $X
docbgn
Gets the value of the player's position. You must specify the component that you want to check, eg. "Pos Y" to check the Y-position.
For "Pos X", the value is relative to the center of the
screen (value 0). Negative is left, positive is right.
Due to historical reasons, "Pos X" does not return absolute
position of the player (i.e. relative to the center of the stage),
which may be the more intuitive behavior.
To get the absolute position of the player, use "Pos X + CameraPos X".
For "Pos Y", the value is relative to the floor. Negative
is higher up, positive is below the floor.
In Ikemen-GO, the RootDist trigger now also accepts a Z argument. Returns the distance between the helper and its root in the Z axis.
docend

trigger	Power
fmt	Power
docbgn
Returns the amount of power the player has.

fmt	StateNo
docbgn
Returns the number of the state that the player was last in. The results of this trigger are not guaranteed to be accurate.
docend

trigger	ProjCancelTime
fmt	ProjCancelTime($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an required nonnegative ID number as an argument.  If the player's last projectile to make any kind of contact was cancelled by an opponent's projectile and had the specified ID number, then ProjCancelTime returns the number of ticks since that contact occurred. If the specified ID number is 0, then the projectile ID is not checked. If no projectile meets all the above conditions, then ProjCancelTime returns -1.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom. If a negative ID is
specified, then the ID defaults to zero.
docend

trigger	ProjContact
fmt	ProjContact$1234 = $value, = $value2
docbgn
This trigger takes an optional ID number as a suffix. If the ID number is omitted, ProjContact returns true if any of the player's projectiles either successfully hit the opponent or were guarded by the opponent. When the ID number is specified, ProjContact returns true only if any of the player's projectiles with the specified ID number either successfully hit the opponent or was guarded.
ProjContact will trigger once for each hit of the projectile, so a
multi-hit projectile can trigger multiple times.
The first form of ProjContact shown above is only valid for one tick
after contact, unlike MoveContact.
For the second form, ProjContact returns true if the projectile made
contact n ticks ago, where n is a nonnegative number satisfying the
relation "n [oper] value2".
Specifying an ID number of 0 gives the same behavior as if the ID
number is omitted (check all projectiles).
docend

trigger	ProjContactTime
fmt	ProjContactTime($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an required nonnegative ID number as an argument.  If the player's last projectile to make any kind of contact, made contact with the opponent and had the specified ID number, then ProjContactTime returns the number of ticks since that contact occurred. If the specified ID number is 0, then the projectile ID is not checked. If no projectile meets all the above conditions, then ProjContactTime returns -1.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom. If a negative ID is
specified, then the ID defaults to zero.
docend

trigger	ProjGuarded
fmt	ProjGuarded$1234 = $value, = $value2
docbgn
This trigger takes an optional ID number as a suffix. If the ID number is omitted, ProjGuarded returns true if any of the player's projectiles were guarded by the opponent. When the ID number is specified, ProjGuarded returns true only if one of the player's projectiles with the specified ID number was guarded by the opponent.
ProjGuarded will trigger once for each hit of the projectile, so a
multi-hit projectile can trigger multiple times.
The first form of ProjGuarded shown above is only valid for one tick
after hit, unlike MoveGuarded.
For the second form, ProjGuarded returns true if the projectile was
guarded n ticks ago, where n is a nonnegative number satisfying the
relation "n [oper] value2".
Specifying an ID number of 0 gives the same behavior as if the ID
number is omitted (check all projectiles).
docend

trigger	ProjGuardedTime
fmt	ProjCancelTime($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an required nonnegative ID number as an argument.  If the player's last projectile to make any kind of contact was guarded by the opponent and had the specified ID number, then ProjGuardedTime returns the number of ticks since that contact occurred. If the specified ID number is 0, then the projectile ID is not checked. If no projectile meets all the above conditions, then ProjGuardedTime returns -1.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom. If a negative ID is
specified, then the ID defaults to zero.
docend

trigger	ProjHit
fmt	ProjHit$1234 = $value, = $value2
docbgn
This trigger takes an optional positive ID number as a suffix. If the ID number is omitted, ProjHit returns true if any of the player's projectiles successfully hit the opponent. When the ID number is specified, ProjHit returns true only if one of the player's projectiles with the specified ID number successfully hit the opponent.
ProjHit will trigger once for each hit of the projectile, so a
multi-hit projectile can trigger multiple times.
The first form of ProjHit shown above is only valid for one tick
after hit, unlike MoveHit.
For the second form, ProjHit returns true if the projectile hit
n ticks ago, where n is a nonnegative number satisfying the relation
"n [oper] value2".
Specifying an ID number of 0 gives the same behavior as if the ID
number is omitted (check all projectiles).
docend

trigger	ProjHitTime
fmt	ProjHitTime($exprn)
docbgn
This trigger takes an required nonnegative ID number as an argument.  If the player's last projectile to make any kind of contact successfully hit the opponent and had the specified ID number, then ProjHit returns the number of ticks since that contact occurred. If the specified ID number is 0, then the projectile ID is not checked.
If no projectile meets all the above conditions, then ProjHitTime returns -1.
Returns bottom if exprn evaluates to bottom. If a negative ID is
specified, then the ID defaults to zero.
docend

trigger	Random
fmt	Random
docbgn
Returns a random number between 0 and 999, inclusive.
docend

trigger	RightEdge
fmt	LeftEdge
docbgn
RightEdge returns the x position of the right edge of the screen, in absolute stage coordinates.
This trigger is equivalent to the expression "CameraPos X + GameWidth / 2".
docend

trigger	RootDist
fmt	RootDist $X
docbgn
This trigger is only valid for helper-type characters.
RootDist returns the distance from the helper to its root. The root is the main player character who owns the helper: for instance, if you select Kumquat to play with, and Kumquat spawns a helper named Kiwi, who in turn spawns a helper named Penguin, then Penguin's root is Kumquat, and Penguin is a descendant of Kumquat. RootDist works similarly to P2Dist.
Returns bottom if the player has no root.
For comparing the Y-distance, RootDist gives the difference in the
heights of the players' Y-axes. A negative value means that the
root is above its descendant.

docend

trigger	TimeMod
fmt	TimeMod = $divisor, $value1
docbgn

The % operator subsumes the functionality of TimeMod, so it is recommended that you use % instead.
Returns bottom if the divisor is 0.
docend

trigger	TopEdge
fmt	TopEdge
docbgn
TopEdge returns the y position of the top edge of the screen, in absolute stage coordinates.
This trigger is equivalent to the expression "Pos Y - ScreenPos Y".

sctrl	AssertCommand	ikgo
req	name	string
opt	buffer.time	0
docbgn
This controller allows (de)activating the player's commands without any button presses. If the player has multiple commands with the same name, the controller will affect all of them.
docend

sctrl	AssertInput	ikgo
req	flag	string
opt	flag2	string
opt	flag3	string
docbgn
This controller allows you to assert up to three input flags simultaneously via single sctrl. Similarly to AssertSpecial, there is no limit how many times this controller is called. Each flag will be automatically "de-asserted" at every game tick, so you must assert a flag for each tick that you want it to be active. Ikemen interprets input flags the same was as if corresponding input keys were pressed.
The flag name can be one of the following input keys (case sensitive):
U, D, L, R, a, b, c, x, y, z, s, d, w, m
docend

sctrl	Camera	ikgo
req	view	string
opt	pos	0.0	0.0
opt	followID	0
docbgn
**This SCTRL is still experimental and subject to possible changes, there is no guarantee this will be supported as is in future IKEMEN Go versions.**
Changes the camera position and the way players interact with screen and stage edges.
When in Free view, Screenbound and Movecamera will not influence camera or char positions. Follow view will only be influenced by Screenbound/Movecamera from the player being followed (this might change in the future).
docend

sctrl	Dialogue	ikgo
req	textX	string
opt	hidebars	0
opt	force	0
docbgn
Assigns dialogue data to be displayed either right before the lifebar calls the fight during first round (last frame of  RoundState = 1) or at the last active frame of the final round (RoundState = 4, right before screen starts fading out). If more than 1 player calls this sctrl, who will end up initiating dialogue is chosen randomly.
How the rendered dialogue will look like (positioning, default face sprites, background definition, default time between text etc.) is controlled by `[Dialogue Info]` screenpack parameters (refer to system.def distributed with engine for a working example). By default player who called the state controller will use screenpack parameters prefixed with *p1* and his *enemy(0)* will be assigned to use *p2* parameters (this is adjustable via text tokens).
With appropriate screenpack parameters it's possible to skip to the next *text* parameter during dialogue via button press, without ending it all together. If this screenpack group is missing, dialogue won't be initiated at all (`enabled` parameter defaults to 0).
**Optional text tokens**
Tokens prefixed with *pX* (where X is 1 or 2) refers to screenpack `[Dialogue Info]` parameters prefixed the same way. Some tokens accepts *redirection* argument that points to which player assets (sprite, sound, anim, state) should be used.
Following redirection are supported:
- `self`: redirects to player that called the sctrl
- `playerno(X)`: redirects to [playerno](Triggers-(new)/#new_playerno) X
- `enemy(X)`: redirects to enemy X of the player that called the sctrl (defaults to 0, the first enemy, if bracket is ommiteed)
- `partner(X)`: redirects to partner X of the player that called the sctrl (defaults to 0, the first partner, if bracket is ommiteed)
- `enemyname(name)`: redirects to the enemy with matching name (the internal `name` parameter specified in .DEF file)
- `partnername(name)`: redirects to the partner with matching name (the internal `name` parameter specified in .DEF file)
Token list:
- `<pX>`: changes which dialogue box side (replace X with 1 or 2) should be used to render text. Defaults to p1 side.
- `<pXname=name>`: changes pX side name displayed during dialogue to the string within quotation marks
- `<pXname=redirection>`: changes pX side name displayed during dialogue to the redirected player displayname (as specified in displayname parameter within the .DEF file)
- `<pXface=redirection,group_no,sprite_no>`: changes pX side sprite group and index that should be used to render face portrait. Defaults to sprite numbers assigned via screenpack (also defaults to these numbers if specified ones are missing, unless *group_no* is set to -1 - in such case face rendering is completely disabled).
- `<sound=redirection,group_no,sound_no,volumescale>`: plays back a sound. *volumescale* argument is optional (defaults to 100).
- `<anim=redirection,anim_no>`: changes the action number of the player's animation
- `<state=redirection,state_no>`: changes the state number of the player
- `<map=redirection,map_name,value,map_type>`: modifies player's map. *map_type* controls what kind of operation on map should be performed (`set`: equivalent of [MapSet](State-controllers/#new_mapset), `add`: equivalent of [MapAdd](State-controllers/#new_mapadd)),
- `<displayname=redirection>`: part of the dialogue text replaced automatically with redirected player displayname (as specified in displayname parameter within the .DEF file)
- `<wait=ticks>`: amount of ticks delay before sctrl resume further text parameter parsing
As an example, below code showcases Symphony of the Night (in)famous cutscene recreated with Dialogue sctrl, using various advanced tokens (keep in mind that in most cases, when you don't have to switch face sprites, play voiceovers or adjust timings, the only commonly used *text* token is `<pX>`)
