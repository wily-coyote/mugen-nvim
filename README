This is a collection of `.vim` config files for M.U.G.E.N's CNS language and
I.K.E.M.E.N's ZSS language. It provides basic syntax highlighting, automatic
filetype detection, playtesting from the editor and snippets via nvim-cmp.

To set up in Neovim, install with Lazy and add to your config:

require("mugen").setup {
	game_path = [[/home/Ikemen-GO/bin/Ikemen_GO]],
	run_command = {"-p1", "%", "-p2", "%"}
}

'%' refers to the current file.
